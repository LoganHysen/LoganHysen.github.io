My research interests span multiple taxa, ecosystems, geographical locations, and scales, with a focus on landscape ecology and conservation. I use spatial techniques to answer applied, methodological, and theoretical questions related to habitat selection, connectivity, human-wildlife coexistence, conservation, sustainable development and more.
